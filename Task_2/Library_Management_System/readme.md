# Library Management System
## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage books, members, borrow/return operations, and notifications in a library setting. This project demonstrates the use of SOLID principles, offering a clean, scalable, and extensible design. The system allows efficient management of the book catalog, membership details, loan tracking, and sends notifications to members for due dates, new arrivals, and overdue books.
