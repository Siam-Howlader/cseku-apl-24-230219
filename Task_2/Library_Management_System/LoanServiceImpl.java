// The LoanServiceImpl class implements the LoanService interface, handling book borrowing and returning for library members.
// This implementation includes functionality to enforce borrowing limits, manage a waitlist for unavailable books,
// and notify members about overdue books. It uses a NotificationService to send reminders and alerts to members as needed,
// providing a streamlined, organized approach to loan management in a library system.
